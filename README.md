# âš¡ ECStatic

*A minimal, extensible ECS framework in C99*

## Features

- **Cache-friendly data storage** --
  component data is stored in contiguous arrays
- **Zero runtime dynamic allocations** --
  all necessary memory is allocated at initialization
- **Extensible design** --
  the core is small enough to understand,
  yet flexible enough to tailor to most applications
